Given that this is a course in the humanities, conversation and debate are essential research methods that we will use to make our points and create new knowledge. That being said, hateful and disrespective comments will not be tolerated. We will be discussing the history of racism and patriarchy. These are sensitive topics. They need to be handled with care. So be open. Voice your opinions. But do so with sensitivity and concern for others.
